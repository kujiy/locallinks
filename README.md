Proceed to LocalLinks installation page on Google Chrome extensions gallery.
The security model of Chrome prevents/blocks the user from being able to open file:// links when the user selects (left clicks) the link, or selects to open them in a new window (middle click). Loading this extension will allow you follow file:// links when you explicitly select them (left click/middle click). The HTML elements it will follow are ones like <a href="file://server/share/file.txt"> or <a href="file://c:/localdiskfile.txt">.

To open a link in the same tab, use the left mouse button.

To open a link in a new background tab, use the middle mouse button.

This extension is modeled after the [LocalLink](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/281) add-on for Firefox.
